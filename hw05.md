7) Logical binary operations can be used to modify bit pattern. Such as

(X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2 =(0000X4X3X2X1)2 

We called that (00001111)2 is a mask which only makes low 4 bits to work. Fill the follow expression

(1) (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 or (00001111)2 = (x8x7x6x51111)2
(2) (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2xor (00001111)2 = (x8x7x6x5 X4⊕1 X3⊕1 X2⊕1 X1⊕1)2
(3) ((X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (11110000)2 )or (not(X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2and (00001111)2) = (x8x7x6x5(1-x4)(1-x3)(1-x2)(1-x1))2

# Part 3

1) Logic gate

In electronics, a logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.

2) Boolean algebra

In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers, and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction and denoted as ∧, the disjunction or denoted as ∨, and the negation not denoted as ¬. It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that elementary algebra describes numeric relations.

触发器

触发器（英语：Flip-flop, FF），中国大陆译作“触发器”、台湾及香港译作“正反器”，是一种具有两种稳态的用于储存的组件，可记录二进制数字信号“1”和“0”。触发器是一种双稳态多谐振荡器（bistable multivibrator）。该电路可以通过一个或多个施加在控制输入端的信号来改变自身的状态，并会有1个或2个输出。触发器是构成时序逻辑电路以及各种复杂数字系统的基本逻辑单元。触发器和锁存器是在计算机、通讯和许多其他类型的系统中使用的数字电子系统的基本组成部分。
