# Part 1

1、Program with machine language according to the following c.

int_8 a = 1;

int_8 c = a + 3;

1）Write your assembly code & machine code

assembly code | machine code
--------------|-------------
LOD #1	      |0001 0100 0000 0001
STO W	      |0000 0101 1000 0000
LOD W	      |0000 0100 1000 0000
ADD #3	      |0001 0000 0000 0011
STO Y	      |0000 0101 1000 0010
HLT	          |0000 1111 0000 0000

2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle

①Fetch the next instruction

下一条指令从当前存储在程序计数器中的存储器地址中取出，并存储到指令寄存器中。PC指向下一个指令。

②Decode the instruction

解码器解释存在于指令寄存器中的编码指令。

③Get data if needed

如果指令有间接地址，从主存储器读取有效地址并取出数据进行处理，然后放入数据寄存器。如果指令是直接指令，则在此期间不执行任何操作。如果这是I / O指令或寄存器指令，则在此期间执行操作。

④Execute the instruction

CPU的控制单元将解码后的信息作为一系列控制信号传递给CPU的相关功能单元，以执行指令所需的动作，操作生成的结果存储在主存储器中或发送到输出设备。

3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU

IR：即指令寄存器，其功能是存放当前正在执行的指令。

PC：即程序计数器，其功能是存放当前欲执行指令的地址，并可自动计数形成下一条指令地址。

ACC：即累加器，其功能是存放运算前的操作数，并可以存放运算结果。

4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine

a和c是标识符，与某个特定的内存单元相关联。在翻译为机器语言时，这些标识符会d代替这个特定内存单元的地址。

2、简答题

1）What are stored in memory?

内存器会存储计算机中所有的信息，包括输入的原始数据、计算机中的程序、中间运行结果以及最终运行结果。

2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?

计算机中的指令和数据可以存放在相同的位置。冯. 诺依曼结构中二者存放在相同位置，而在哈佛结构中二者被分开存储

3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.

0001 0100 0000 0001是一个指令，其中前八位是指令说明符，后八位是操作数说明符。

指令说明符前三位全为0，第四位是寻址模式，其为1表示后面的操作数是地址，后四位是操作码，这里为0100表示把操作数载入到寄存器中。

操作数说明符在寻址模式为0，即立即寻址时表示一个数值，也就是操作数；在寻址模式为1，即直接寻址时表示一个地址，操作数为地址中的数。

1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）

An assembly language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program’s statements and the architecture’s machine code instructions.Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction, but assembler directives,macrosand symbolic labels of program and memory locations are often also supported. Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. The conversion process is referred to as assembly, or assembling the source code.

2）编译（Compiler）

A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.[1] A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation. Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient design and correct transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness.

3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates

4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time

5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program’s execution, including by other procedures or itself.
